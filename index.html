								<b><br>Victory Glamour Shot</b><br> Victory glamour shot of a successful sample rock coring! This is the first time that the rover has imaged this side view of a sample core inside a drill bit. When it comes to rover hardware views, the Mastcam-Z operations team has already commanded many different kinds of imaging requests from the team by this point in the mission. So when these frames came down from Mars, I was eager to check out this novel shot by Mastcam-Z! I wasn't even on shift that day, but when it comes to sampling days, many of us on the team are incredibly eager to see the results as soon as possible. Upon loading up the image, I knew right away it was an instant favorite. Part of my job operating the cameras is to make sure that they were correctly in focus when taking images, and that was the first thing that stuck out to me here. The right Mastcam-Z camera was set to its maximum zoom (110 mm focal length) and used to take this photo. Our uplink colleagues at Malin Space Science Systems did a fantastic job setting up the autofocus. The result is almost artistic!<br>
								<br>This sample is called Swift Rock and it is the first likely sedimentary rock sample collected on the mission so far (on sol 490, July 7, 2022). It also happens to be the longest so far at 6.69 cm (2.63 in) long! The team has been collecting paired samples at each location, so five sols later on sol 495 we acquired the second sample, Skyland, which is 5.85 cm (2.30 in) long. The rover is currently at the base of the Jezero delta front at an area called Skinner Ridge. We have been seeing more instances of beautifully-layered sedimentary rock around here, <b><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/my-favorite-martian-image-enchanted-rocks-at-jezero-crater">exciting many of our mission's scientists.</a></b>
								The hardware you see in this image is the drill bit attached to the rover arm. Since this imaging sequence took photos using both left and right cameras centered on the rock core, 3-D views can also eventually be created from the resulting image pair. The novel Mastcam-Z imaging parameters from helping to confirm this successful core sample were also used in the planning of the core tip images of its paired sample taken a few sols later. Finally, in addition to providing engineering and science support, to me it is just a stunning picture all on its own — human-assembled hardware being used, getting dirty, and working nominally on Mars! 
								<br><br><b><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-rock-samples/">Here is a link to the Perseverance Rover's Mars Rock Sample Collection Log</a></b>, which is updated after each sample pair has been collected. The left and right eye Mastcam-Z images from this core imaging campaign can all be found online on the <b><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/">NASA Mars 2020 Raw Images web site</a></b> by clicking “Mastcam-Z – Left” and “Mastcam-Z – Right” and Filtering on sol 490.

								<b>Landscape Poetry</b><br> On Sol 422, Mastcam-Z took this image during a routine dust devil atmospheric imaging activity. Here you see the Jezero crater delta front to the left and the Seítáh area leading toward the landing site to the right. I didn't know that the the serene-like rover tracks traversing in the middle would be perfectly centered in this frame, a wonderful coincidence. You see layers of mountains on the far side of Jezero crater disappearing into the dusty atmosphere in the distance. A familiar sight on a windy day in a dusty region here on Earth. The sand dunes in the foreground with neatly manicured boulders lay in patterns manipulated by the Martian wind over time, disturbed only recently by the fresh tracks of the rover. 
								<br><br>To me, this image is symbolic of a brief moment of reflection of how far our fearless roving explorer has come in over 400 sols since landing on the dusty red planet. Perseverance has recently broken a few long distance driving records, including its <b><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/367/first-multiple-sol-drive/">first multiple-sol drive (sols 350-352)</a></b>. Also, while entirely too small to actually see with the constraints of the resolution of this image, Ingenuity is also located somewhere in the footprint of this frame. The Mastcam-Z cameras are first and foremost a scientific camera suite, but they can surely take a poetic landscape shot!

								<br><br>How do you prepare for a road trip? On Earth, you can just type in a destination on your smartphone and start driving. On Mars, there's no GPS or roads—only images and data provided by orbiting spacecraft. 
								<br><br>NASA's Perseverance rover launches in late July or early August and will arrive on Mars in February 2021. The rover will land near an ancient river delta. Deltas form as rivers deposit sediment from upstream sources into standing bodies of water, like lakes or oceans. On Earth, these areas tend to teem with life. The Perseverance rover will search for signs of past life while collecting soil and rock samples for future return to Earth.
								<br><br>How do you safely drive a Mars rover around an ancient river delta while planning scientifically interesting places to perform fieldwork and collect samples? For starters, you need good maps, built using images and data collected by spacecraft in orbit. Unfortunately, our previous maps of Jezero crater have very large scales and don't show the kind of detail we'll need for day-to-day trip planning. Here's an example: notice the one kilometer scale mark in the lower-right corner, and you'll see why regional maps like this are not so suitable for planning rover activities!
								<br><br>To level up our mapping game, a subset of the Perseverance rover science team formed a mapping group in mid 2019. The dozens of volunteer mappers included people in all stages of their careers, from first-time mappers and rover newbies to senior planetary scientists with decades of experience with rover missions. The team was led by geologic mapping specialists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California.
								<br><br>It's worth mentioning that this process had benefits beyond navigating the rover and planning scientific field trips. Another important objective was team building and creating a sense of investment in our rover's future home! 
								<br><br>The JPL mapping specialists first laid a grid of 1.2 by 1.2 kilometer (0.75 by 0.75 mile) blocks over the landing zone and surrounding region, giving us distinct blocks—which we call quads—to map.
								<br><br>Spanning the quads are 7 distinct geographic regions—different surface types like delta, crater floor, and crater rim—each of which was assigned 2 or 3 mapping leads. The leads coordinated mapping of the individual quads in their areas and also coordinated with one another to ensure consistency and continuity across the entire grid.
								<br><br>Each quad received an informal name to make it easier to keep track of them. The Perseverance rover science team is an international conglomerate of scientists and engineers, so we chose a naming theme of parks and preserves from around the world. During the actual mission, this will also help us choose informal names for rocks and features the rover studies.
								<br><br>To map each quad, we started with a base map of high-resolution images from Mars orbiters and added to that topography and slope maps showing changes in elevation as well as false-color maps showing differences in surface mineralogy. 
								<br>
								<br>Here's an example of how one quad came together over time:
