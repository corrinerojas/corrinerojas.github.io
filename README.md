Welcome to my little space on the web. Here are some links you may find helpful.

My name is Corrine Rojas and I am currently a Mars rover camera Operations Engineer (Payload Downlink Lead) for Mastcam-Z, which is aboard the Perseverance Rover on Mars. 

I am also a planetary scientist, focusing on the [Moon](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/2499.pdf) and [Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/people/profile/index.cfm?id=23248).





### Favorite Snapshot of the Perseverance Rover Mission (so far!)

>Inaugural Mastcam-Z panaorama of a Martian sunset on Jezero crater, Mars, taken on sol 257 (Nov 9, 2021). Usually Martian sunsets have a blue tinge due to how light scatters more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths like we see here on Earth. This sunset appears to be more muted than the Martian sunsets we're used to, and we suspect it's due to fewer dust particles in the atmosphere during the time of this imaging. This panorama was been radiance calibrated and white-balanced to remove camera artifacts.
