Welcome to my little space on the web. Here are some links you may find helpful.

My name is Corrine Rojas and I am currently a Mars rover camera Operations Engineer (Payload Downlink Lead) for Mastcam-Z, which is aboard the Perseverance Rover on Mars. 

I am also a planetary scientist, focusing on the [Moon](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/2499.pdf) and [Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/people/profile/index.cfm?id=23248).





### Favorite Snapshot of the Perseverance Rover Mission (so far!)

>Inaugural Mastcam-Z panaorama of a Martian sunset on Jezero crater, Mars, taken on sol 257 (Nov 9, 2021). Usually Martian sunsets have a blue tinge due to how light scatters more efficiently than colors with longer wavelengths like we see here on Earth. This sunset appears to be more muted than the Martian sunsets we're used to, and we suspect it's due to fewer dust particles in the atmosphere during the time of this imaging. This panorama has been radiance calibrated and white-balanced to remove camera artifacts. 




### Projects

This area will get populated as I work through some project ideas. These project will be predominantly in python or using python-wrapped toolkits as I master the language.

#### Flight Tracker
I live close to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and I am an airplane enthusiast. I've been wanting to take a stab at creating an application that tracks local flights in and out of Sky Harbor for a longtime, especially when I see a larger bird coming in! Here I use python and OpenSky traffic data visualized using bokeh and pandas libraries. I followed a fabulous tutorial available on geodose -- shout out to them! 

I am currently working on backend testing of a realtime web browser-based application version that callsback every 5 seconds.

#### NAIF SPICE Kernel Visualizations

"He who controls the spice controls the universe." - Frank Herbert

It's no secret how important NAIF SPICE kernels are to running a NASA mission spacecraft. I am currently working through tutorials from the python-based wrapper.

Here is the requisite Cassini position relative to Saturn visualization, followed by a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter example.
